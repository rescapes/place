 * The private test config is used for testing.
 * In production the application seeds the ApolloClient with settings from the application.
 * The production application would read a settings key from an environment variable and
 * pull the correct settings from a database or private file.
 * Settings are used to determine the shape and initial values of the Apollo in memory cache.
 * Since we have a settings class in the API, the settings must match the shape of the API's settings.data object,
 * unless they are cache only values like testAuthorization and mapboxApiAccessToken below.
